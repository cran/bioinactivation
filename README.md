bioinactivation: a package for modelling microbial inactivation in R.
---------------------------------------------------------------------

The bioinactivation package implements several function for the modelization of microbial inactivation in R. It includes:

-   functions for the prediction of isothermal and non-isothermal microbial inactivation.
-   functions for the adjustment of inactivation models to isothermal experiments.
-   functions for the fitting of inactivation models to dynamic experiments.
